This folder contains the source code, report, and design documents for my final project for CS 340: Intro to Databases. My project group and I designed a relational database and user interface for a fictional business (Ophelia's Potions and Spells Emporium-- we had fun with it) to manage sales. 

Final_Submission.pdf contains documentation for the development of the database, including descriptions of the different tables and schema diagrams to demonstrate the relationships.
