# Hello, and welcome to My Computer Science ePortfolio!

My name is Angelia-Grace Martin. I am a recent graduate of Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This portfolio showcases several of my capstone projects that I completed during the course of my degree, as well as personal projects that I have completed on my own time to hone and demonstrate my expertise in Computer Science. This is not the sum total of the projects that I have coded, only some of the best examples! 

In the folders for my CS 290 and CS 340 capstone projects, you will find source code, demos, and reports for **full stack web applications** which demonstrate my familiarity with both **relational and non-relational databases.** 

CS 291 and CS 325 demonstrate my knowledge of **data structures, algorithms, and algorithm analysis.** My MinPuzzle.py recursive algorithm solves a maze using the strategy of recursive backtracking!

My **professional and technical writing samples** include progress reports, annotated project demonstrations, design mockups, code reviews, documentation for source code, and other samples such as instruction manuals. 


# More About Me

### Academic Excellence

As a recipient of the prestigious National Merit Award and the Finley Academic Excellence Scholarship, I have been achieving academic excellence since my teenage years. During my degree, I worked multiple jobs, cared for sick family members during times of crisis, and financially supported my household, staying on track to graduate and maintaining a strong GPA all the while. I even completed my degree requirements early, finishing out my program with a half course load. 


### Professional Background

In addition to my scholarships, I have worked since I was 15 years old in order to support myself (and my loved ones) during college. I have served as an assistant swim coach, a swim instructor, and a lifeguard at various facilities. I have also worked as an au pair. Most recently, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the Computer Science program at Oregon State University, a role which I was selected for due to high academic performance in several of my major-specific classes. 


### Professional Goals

My short-term goal is to secure a role in database management or app development, or any role that allows me to work with a team and gain more hands-on industry experience, and to develop my portfolio with more independent programming projects. Long-term, I am excited to see what the future holds; I have experience both in and out of the classroom with a wide variety of disciplines within the field of computer science, and my most important priority is to make an impact with my career. Our world runs on computers, and there's not a single facet of modern life that isn't impacted in some way by code that somebody wrote, so I know that the possibilities are endless.
